Coming across the carcass —\  
Broken: bones, heart, and dreams,\  
Just wondering where it all went wrong,\  
Pointing to the poison in my veins.  

The world is broken, yet sane;\  
Broken people — interaction we refrain.\  
“They are going through stuff.” “Will I ever be enough?”\  
Are they a mirror showing one’s own pain?  

Love works in mysterious ways —\  
One moment affection, next moment frustration,\  
Long-term or short-term phrases;\  
No warranty during bond creation.  

Dark clouds appear on the horizon,\  
Lush vegetation braces for destruction,\  
Broken people look for salvation,\  
End up bumping into people in similar situations.  

Broken strangers meeting broken strangers,\  
Each trying to fit the other into their pre-existing mould.\  
Some just give up, some try to change,\  
Eventually, the environment is just cold.  

But if they just be patient —\  
Broken things are still God’s creation.\  
If considered like a puzzle,\  
They are in for lasting elation.  

And so they move forward:\  
Broken people with their broken things,\  
Carefully examining the pieces on the floor,\  
Creating a mosaic — something beautiful and totally different.
