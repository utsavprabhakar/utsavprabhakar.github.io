**Strange waters**

There once was a traveller\
Who hadn’t left his home\
Was he always going to wander\
About the vast sea and the glittering stones

He met an experience traveller\
Unaware of the weight he’d carry\
The feelings were new, his breath irregular\
Was this someone he had to marry

They travelled to an island\
She wanted to settle down\
A terrifying ocean is all they could see\
The island somehow became home

A game started, initially for fun\
A game of pretence, a game no one won\
Is this what life had become\
The breeze had changed, the birds could sense a storm

The fire dwindled, the nets laid bare\
The fish were few, just stagnant air\
Ambition was low, tensions were high\
For one of them, there was no one to care

One day the ship was gone\
Remaining food and water also taken\
He was left to fend for himself\
A spark of freedom in him had awoken

The weather improved, the storm cleared\
Doubt gave way to loathing’s end\
The breeze was calm, so was his heart\
Strange waters now became his friend
