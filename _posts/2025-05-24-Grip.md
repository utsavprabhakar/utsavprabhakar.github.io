Your love is making me cry,\
Where do you think you are going,\
Leaving in a hurry, no kiss, not even a goodbye\
Can you also take all the memories and all your things

So much darkness even in the light\
Are you behind the curtain, will you come back through the door\
Why was I shown our future - “so bright”\
Now you leave my abandoned heart on the floor

Isn’t there a permanent Erase all button,\
Shut down the pain, drink down the sorrow\
Should I turn to alcohol or hope,\
Both are in plenty and potent - to borrow

I find myself holding on tightly,\
Whats there to hold, why should I treat lightly,\
This darkness that surrounds me, feel scared yet hopeful,\
Somebody get the light, it was an empty fist only

How did you slip away,\
Was I holding on too tightly\
Our dreams, our future, our life\
Or was it just mine and you were slithering away slightly

It was written on the wall,\
I was too blind to see,\
The moment you entered my life,\
The ending was there, smiling cunningly

Just breathe, just think,\
Let the blood flow, let it just sink\
Its me who is holding on to imaginary things,\
Distracting me from my inevitable brink

This is becoming a habit\
Distraction with pain, distraction with laughter,\
Other hands are reaching out to me\
But this time the grip will be lighter
