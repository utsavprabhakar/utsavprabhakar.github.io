Love is a **_drug_**. You hear this so many times and yet somehow I never could relate. Somehow love didn’t have a finite meaning in my mind. I used to get my superficial meaning from those couples reels: waking up, going to the gym, a small spank by the male to keep the “spark”, personal space for both and cuddle. It also used to be the occasional spontaneous cute actions like dancing in the rain, laughing so hard you snort, passionate kissing whenever wherever and all that jazz.

For me, love was a series of decisions you take throughout your lifetimes (also heard or seen on social media itself). It could be with the same person or multiple other people be it family, friends, pets etc. 

Now love is a drug. It can also **_make you blind_**. Again, never made sense earlier but now it does. Why is it blind? Why does our mind leave it rational decision making responsibilities for something so fleeting as love. Why is the heart okay with the aches and still continue to want that same drug that makes it ache. I know there are rational explanations involving our hormones but isn’t there a non biological answer to this, something that can help common folks deal? 

Coming back to blindness, love also has the power to **_make you a different individual_**. An individual your loved one would want you to be. For children, if they get good grades they are loved so being academically strong is something children cultivate. For adults, some people will just succumb to what their partners tell them to do for partner pleasing. Many are just conflict avoidant folks. But what about those social media stuff that asks us to not to change for anyone?

_Now_, love is a drug causing blindness and “temporary” personality changes which later might lead to resentment. We as a society still romanticise the fuck out of it. We as a society still have so many people trying to find their hero, trying to find their Simran, trying to find that person who will make this search worthwhile. 

But we as a society are completely unaware of behaviours of individuals. We all expect the same form of love to happen to us, the one whose idea we acquired through our primary caregivers, pop culture or reddit. Who is gonna teach us what love is? It is not supposed to be boring and I in no way condone that. Love has this keen sting that everyone man women and child should feel at least once in their lives. But we as a generation are broken(hardened). Broken by our experiences, broken by our environments and our present and past lovers. It’s normalised for people to be stupid in their initial relationships, make a lot of mistakes and technically harm the mental health of people at the receiving end. I get that, but what about those folks who don’t have a good support system to get through it. The scorn and hidden shame they carry inside them for not being able to move on. For almost majority of the people don’t get the exact reason for a breakup. For those unlucky few who do, it’s almost always more damaging. 
Eventually these heartbroken people realise the issues. Eventually they rise and overcome obstacles, as humans have been for millennia. But having this knowledge early can be really illuminating. 

Below I will try to provide a basic explanation(my viewpoint) of why shit happens in relationships. The understanding of attachment styles plays a crucial role in working towards a _secure_ relationship. 

**Disclaimer**: I a neither a clinical psychologist, therapist or even a very experienced individual in relationships. I have just been trying to make "some" sense of why things have happened to me a certain way and how I can make them better without having to change myself for the other person. 

**Attachment Styles** 
There are mainly 4. Secure, Disorganised, Anxious and Avoidant. Normally, I would ask you to just google these styles but mentioning them here for completeness. 

Anixous
Just like a money plant, anxious people thrive when they know they have a stable support system who is not going to leave them any time soon.

Behaviour
- Crave closeness and intimacy
- Equate intimacy to love
- In a relationship (specifically with aviodant people), they could become overly clingy, seek reassurances frequently and experience heightened anxiety


Avoidant
Like succulents, avoidant people often dont need much attention and value their own space. They want to be left alone and not be tended to frequently.

Behaviour
- Suppress their emotions
- Sometimes avoid intimacy
- May appear independent and self-reliant but secretly crave connection and affection

_Not covering secure and disorganised. Feel free to google them._

So why am I giving you this bookish googled definitions of this? Because its important to understand these styles in a relationship. Humans often are not able to communicate effectively when they are high on emotions and relationships often break just because things turn sour and nobody address stuff. Just to be clear, if you have an anxious attachment style doesnt mean you have anxiety. Likewise for other styles. 

Now, all these styles cant be studied in isolation. We can be avoidant in one relationship and anxious in the other. All this stems mainly from our opinions of ourselves and others.

The image is quite self explanatory. 


**Secure Rerooting**
Its not all doom and gloom. There is hope for rerooting your money plants or succulents. What I am about to write below might feel very cliche but its pretty much all that is required in order to atleast _try_ to solve the problems of a relationship instead of just giving up. 

_Notice_
What are the situations in which I feel uprooted? How is this situation making me feel?

_Balance_
How do i maintain a positive view of both myself and others?

_Pause_
Am I feeling this way in response to this specific situation, or in response to messages I may have received in the past

_Communicate_
The most crucial part. How can I clearly express my needs right now? How can I make sure this is a collaborative and respectful conversation?


Thanks if you have come so far. You got this, you beautiful reader. Ending this blog with my favourite quote of all time.
