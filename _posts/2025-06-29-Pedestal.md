Cold winter evening,\
you fly from dangerous worlds,\
Stumbling upon me by chance,\
Landing upon my pedestal, flag unfurled

The wind is flowing through your hair,\
The nights longer, long enough to care,\
Time stands still, when I see you up there,\
Doubts start creeping, stagnant air

Reality starts hitting,\
The wind direction keeps changing\
The inevitability of you flying away,\
The fear of the pedestal not having enough space

Space for you and your ego,\
Space for material things, space for fickle innuendos,\
It always felt tight, it almost never felt right,\
Guess it is right for you to have reservations

You contemplate flying,\
Flying to safer havens\
You point out issues,\
God of small things and communication

I shout, I implore,\
Enervated by reaching out to you,\
The pedestal so high, the sentiment super low,\
Guess flying is your only option, I will not be your crew.

And so you fly away\
Not in night but in broad day,\
The space left on my pedestal resembles the one in my life,\
Pain comes in mysterious ways

So my pedestal remains empty,\
Awaiting its next empress,\
The expectations remain high,\
Will I ever be that impressed?
